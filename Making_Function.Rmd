# start small
Z scores
```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(20, mean = 10, sd = 3.5)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec)
```

write a function to compute z scores
```{r}
z_scores = function(x) {
  z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  z
}
```

let's try out the function
```{r}
z_scores(x = x_vec)

num_vec = rnorm(123, mean = 14, sd = 0.4)
z_scores(x = num_vec)
```
